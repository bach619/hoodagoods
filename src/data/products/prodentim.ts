  detailedReview: {
    introduction: `ProDentim is a chewable probiotic dental supplement designed to rebalance the oral microbiome using clinically studied strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, plus natural antimicrobials and mineral support. It's manufactured in a U.S. FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility and sold exclusively through the official website, supporting dental health beyond brushing and flossing.`,
    keyFeatures: `ProDentim delivers a synergistic blend of probiotics (L. paracasei, L. reuteri, B. lactis), prebiotic inulin, malic acid for whitening, tricalcium phosphate for enamel and mint for oral freshness. The formulation is free of GMOs, gluten, and harsh chemicals. It comes in chewable form with bundle pricing and claims backed by facility certifications and a 60-day refund policy.`,
    performance: `User testimonials and company press releases indicate improvements in gum strength, reduced plaque, fresher breath, and whiter teeth within 4–8 weeks. However, Trustpilot reviews are overwhelmingly negative (1.5/5) citing refund refusal and adverse effects like new cavities or recession. While some users report positive experiences (e.g., Walmart review praising immune balance), others strongly criticize questionable effectiveness and refund practices.`,
    valueForMoney: `At $49 per bottle, ProDentim is priced mid-range for dental supplements. Bulk purchase discounts and free shipping increase value. However, widespread trust issues, refund complications, and uncertainty about clinical validation temper its worth. Customers should consider risk vs potential benefit and verify authenticity via the official site.`,
    whoShouldBuy: `ProDentim may appeal to adults seeking a probiotic-based oral care solution, especially those frustrated with conventional dental products. If you're open to trialing microbiome-focused supplements and can tolerate potential refund hurdles, it might be worth exploring. Caution is advised for those with sensitive dental health or a history of refund disputes.`,
    conclusion: `ProDentim offers a novel approach to oral health through a probiotic-rich chewable supplement backed by a certified facility. Though it shows promise in gut-mouth microbial science, its credibility is undermined by poor customer service, refund issues, and lack of transparent clinical data. Potential buyers should purchase from the official website to ensure authenticity and maintain realistic expectations—some may experience benefits, others should remain cautious.`
