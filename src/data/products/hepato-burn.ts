  detailedReview: {
    introduction: `HepatoBurn is a dual-action capsule supplement that targets liver health and fat-burning. It combines a Liver Purification Complex and a Liver Fat-Burning Complex, designed to support detoxification while enhancing metabolism—all in a stimulant-free formula manufactured in certified U.S. facilities. With a generous 60-day refund policy and tiered pricing for bulk packages, HepatoBurn aims to deliver long-term wellness through optimized liver function.`,
    keyFeatures: `The product consists of two proprietary blends: the Purification Complex (milk thistle, betaine, glutathione, berberine, artichoke, molybdenum) and the Fat-Burning Complex (resveratrol, green tea extract, genistein, chlorogenic acid, choline). It comes in capsule form, is non-GMO, soy/dairy-free, and produced in FDA-registered, GMP-certified facilities. Users can choose 2-, 3-, or 6-bottle packages with increasing discounts and a 60-day money-back policy even for empty bottles.`,
    performance: `User feedback and recent reviews (e.g., r/KomiSan thread, GlobNewswire) indicate positive outcomes such as 5–16 lb weight loss over 2–3 months, increased energy, reduced bloating, clearer skin, better digestion, and improved sleep. Side effects are minimal and typically limited to mild digestive changes or headaches during the initial detox period. While no clinical trials exist on the full formula, the ingredients are backed by credible evidence for supporting liver function and metabolic health.`,
    valueForMoney: `At $49–79 per bottle depending on the package, HepatoBurn provides strong value compared to premium supplements that often charge more for similar ingredients. The 60-day guarantee reduces risk, and user testimonies suggest the benefits can offset the cost—making it a cost-effective option for those focusing on liver and metabolic wellness.`,
    whoShouldBuy: `HepatoBurn is ideal for individuals experiencing stubborn fat, low energy, bloating, or mild liver enzyme elevations who want a natural, stimulant-free metabolic support supplement. It's geared towards users who prefer clean-label ingredients and long-term health strategies, and who are comfortable purchasing directly from the official website.`,
    conclusion: `HepatoBurn offers a thoughtful, science-based approach to liver and metabolic support, combining research-backed ingredients in a certified manufacturing context. While independent clinical trials on the full product are lacking, strong anecdotal evidence, clean formulation, and a solid refund policy make it a compelling choice for individuals seeking a liver-centric supplement. Just ensure authenticity by purchasing from the official site to avoid counterfeits, and consult a healthcare provider if you have existing medical conditions or are taking medications.`
